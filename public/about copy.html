<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I code, I create, I solve. </p>

<p>At Amazon, I built quality improvement projects for AGI and Alexa ML teams using React.js, Bootstrap, and jQuery, discovered my passion for front-end development, and turned that curiosity into purpose, now fuelling me to explore DSA problem solving.With 4+ years of operations experience, I bring a strong understanding of process management, precision, and people. I have learned to simplify complex problems, think analytically, and deliver with consistency. The experience evolved into a passion for clean, user-focused, and intuitive web experiences with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js.</p>

<p>Beyond work, I seek inspiration through travel, painting, and a disciplined practice of meditation and gym training. Each pursuit keeps me grounded, creative, and focused on growth. </p>
<p> Grateful for the journey so far, I aspire to channel my energy, creativity, and vision to become a creative powerhouse in the business world.</p>

<p>'I built myself ' is my favourite quote.</p>
